    <h1>Binary Systems & Boolean Algebra</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Binary Numbers & Base Conversions</h2>
        <p>Binary numbers are numbers expressed in base-2 numeral system, using only two symbols: 0 and 1. Computers internally use binary to represent and manipulate all data.</p>
        <p><strong>Base Conversions:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Decimal to Binary:</strong> Divide the number by 2 repeatedly and record the remainders.</li>
            <li><strong>Binary to Decimal:</strong> Multiply each bit by 2 raised to its positional power and sum them up.</li>
            <li><strong>Binary to Hexadecimal:</strong> Group bits in 4s from right to left and convert each group to its hexadecimal equivalent.</li>
            <li><strong>Hexadecimal to Binary:</strong> Replace each hexadecimal digit with its 4-bit binary equivalent.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Signed Numbers & Complements</h2>
        <p>Signed numbers in binary allow for representation of both positive and negative integers.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sign-Magnitude Representation:</strong> The most significant bit (MSB) represents the sign (0 for positive, 1 for negative), and the remaining bits represent the magnitude.</li>
            <li><strong>1's Complement:</strong> Invert all the bits of a number to find its 1's complement.</li>
            <li><strong>2's Complement:</strong> Take the 1's complement and add 1 to it. This is the most common method for representing signed numbers in computers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Using 2's complement simplifies arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction in digital systems.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Binary Codes & Storage</h2>
        <p>Binary codes are systems of representing text, instructions, or other data using binary digits.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>BCD (Binary Coded Decimal):</strong> Each decimal digit is represented by its 4-bit binary equivalent.</li>
            <li><strong>Gray Code:</strong> A binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit. Used to prevent errors in digital circuits.</li>
            <li><strong>ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange):</strong> A 7-bit character code used for text representation in computers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Storage:</strong> Binary storage refers to how data is stored in memory devices using binary numbers (0s and 1s), such as in RAM, hard drives, or SSDs.</p>

        <h2>Boolean Algebra & Logic Gates</h2>
        <p>Boolean Algebra is a branch of algebra that deals with true or false values, usually represented as 1 and 0. It is fundamental to the design of digital circuits and computer systems.</p>

        <h3>Basic Boolean Operations:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AND (·):</strong> Output is true if both inputs are true.</li>
            <li><strong>OR (+):</strong> Output is true if at least one input is true.</li>
            <li><strong>NOT (¬ or '):</strong> Output is the inverse of the input.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Important Boolean Laws:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Identity Law</li>
            <li>Null Law</li>
            <li>Idempotent Law</li>
            <li>Inverse Law</li>
            <li>Distributive Law</li>
            <li>Associative Law</li>
            <li>Commutative Law</li>
            <li>DeMorgan’s Theorems</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Logic Gates:</h3>
        <p>Logic gates are physical devices implementing Boolean functions. Basic logic gates include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AND Gate:</strong> Outputs 1 only if both inputs are 1.</li>
            <li><strong>OR Gate:</strong> Outputs 1 if at least one input is 1.</li>
            <li><strong>NOT Gate:</strong> Outputs the complement of the input.</li>
            <li><strong>NAND Gate:</strong> Output is the complement of AND.</li>
            <li><strong>NOR Gate:</strong> Output is the complement of OR.</li>
            <li><strong>XOR Gate:</strong> Outputs 1 if inputs are different.</li>
            <li><strong>XNOR Gate:</strong> Outputs 1 if inputs are the same.</li>
        </ul>
