<h1>Network Security Basics</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Introduction to Network Security</h2>
    <p><strong>Network Security</strong> refers to the policies, practices, and technologies used to prevent, detect, and monitor unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of a computer network and network-accessible resources.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Objectives of Network Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information and processing methods.</li>
        <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Ensuring that authorized users have access to information and associated assets when required.</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Verifying the identity of users and systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-repudiation:</strong> Guaranteeing that a party in a communication cannot deny the authenticity of their signature on a message or a file.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Common Network Security Threats</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Viruses and Worms:</strong> Malicious software that can infect systems and spread across networks.</li>
        <li><strong>Trojan Horses:</strong> Malicious programs that appear to be legitimate software.</li>
        <li><strong>Phishing Attacks:</strong> Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by disguising as a trustworthy entity.</li>
        <li><strong>Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:</strong> Overwhelming a system with traffic to make it unavailable to users.</li>
        <li><strong>Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:</strong> Intercepting communications between two parties to steal or manipulate data.</li>
        <li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> Malware that locks or encrypts a victim's data and demands payment for restoration.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Network Security Measures</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Firewalls:</strong> Hardware or software that filters incoming and outgoing traffic based on security rules.</li>
        <li><strong>Antivirus and Antimalware Software:</strong> Tools that detect and remove malicious software.</li>
        <li><strong>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):</strong> Systems that monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and potential threats.</li>
        <li><strong>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs):</strong> Secure tunnels that encrypt data over the internet.</li>
        <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Defining who or what is allowed to access resources on a network.</li>
        <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Converting data into a coded form to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Requiring multiple forms of verification to grant access to resources.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Best Practices for Network Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Regularly update software and operating systems to patch vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li>Use strong, unique passwords and change them periodically.</li>
        <li>Implement a strong firewall and antivirus system.</li>
        <li>Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.</li>
        <li>Educate employees and users about security policies and phishing attacks.</li>
        <li>Use encryption for sensitive data transmissions.</li>
        <li>Back up data regularly and store backups securely.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Network security is crucial in todayâ€™s connected world. With rising cyber threats, implementing strong network security practices is essential for protecting sensitive information and maintaining the trust of users and customers.</p>
