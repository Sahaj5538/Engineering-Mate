</head>
<body>

<h1>1. Electromagnetic Spectrum (Detailed)</h1>
<p>The electromagnetic (EM) spectrum encompasses all types of electromagnetic radiation, which is energy that travels through space in the form of waves. These waves are characterized by their frequency (ν) and wavelength (λ), which are inversely proportional (c = λν, where c is the speed of light).</p>

<h2>Regions of Electromagnetic Spectrum:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Radio Waves:</strong> Used in communication, broadcasting, and radar. Longest wavelengths, lowest frequencies.</li>
    <li><strong>Microwaves:</strong> Used in microwave ovens, radar, and telecommunications. Absorbed by water molecules, causing heating.</li>
    <li><strong>Infrared (IR):</strong> Associated with heat. Used in thermal imaging, remote controls, and spectroscopy.</li>
    <li><strong>Visible Light:</strong> Portion detectable by the human eye. Different wavelengths correspond to different colors.</li>
    <li><strong>Ultraviolet (UV):</strong> Higher energy than visible light. Causes ionization and chemical reactions. Used in sterilization and tanning.</li>
    <li><strong>X-rays:</strong> High-energy radiation used in medical imaging to penetrate soft tissues and reveal bones.</li>
    <li><strong>Gamma Rays:</strong> Highest energy radiation, produced by nuclear reactions and radioactive decay. Used in cancer treatment.</li>
</ul>

<h1>2. Molecular Spectroscopy (Elaborated)</h1>
<p>Molecular spectroscopy studies the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with molecules. Molecules absorb EM radiation and transition between different energy levels, providing insight into molecular structure and dynamics.</p>

<h2>a. Rotational Spectroscopy (More Detail)</h2>
<p><strong>Rotation of Molecules:</strong> Molecules rotate around their center of mass. Rotational energy levels are quantized.</p>
<p><strong>Rotational Energy Levels:</strong> For a rigid diatomic molecule:</p>
<p><em>E<sub>J</sub> = B J (J + 1)</em></p>
<p>where B is the rotational constant, and J is the rotational quantum number (J = 0, 1, 2, ...).</p>

<p><strong>Rotational Constant (B):</strong></p>
<p><em>B = h / (8π²Ic)</em></p>
<p>where h = Planck's constant, I = moment of inertia, c = speed of light.</p>

<p><strong>Selection Rules:</strong> ΔJ = ±1.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> A molecule in J = 1 state can absorb a photon to move to J = 2 or emit a photon to move to J = 0.</p>

<h2>b. Vibrational Spectroscopy (More Detail)</h2>
<p><strong>Vibrating Diatomic Molecule:</strong> Molecules oscillate around their equilibrium positions; energy levels are quantized.</p>

<h3>Simple and Anharmonic Oscillators:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Simple Harmonic Oscillator:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Potential energy: <em>V(x) = (1/2) kx²</em></p>
<p>Vibrational energy levels: <em>E<sub>v</sub> = ℏω(v + 1/2)</em></p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Anharmonic Oscillator:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Corrected energy levels: <em>E<sub>v</sub> = ℏω(v + 1/2) - ℏωx<sub>e</sub>(v + 1/2)²</em></p>

<p>where x<sub>e</sub> is the anharmonicity constant.</p>

<p><strong>Selection Rules:</strong> For harmonic oscillators, Δv = ±1. For anharmonic, Δv = ±1, ±2, ±3,... (higher overtones have lower intensity).</p>

<h3>Applications of IR Spectroscopy:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Functional Group Identification:</strong> Characteristic absorption bands (e.g., C=O ~1700 cm⁻¹, O-H ~3200–3600 cm⁻¹).</li>
    <li><strong>Molecular Structure Determination:</strong> Analyzing the IR spectrum reveals the presence of functional groups.</li>
</ul>

<h2>c. NMR Spectroscopy (More Detail)</h2>
<h3>Criteria for NMR Activity:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>NMR-active Nuclei:</strong> Odd number of protons or neutrons (e.g., <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>19</sup>F, <sup>31</sup>P).</li>
    <li><strong>Non-magnetic Nuclei:</strong> Even number of protons and neutrons (e.g., <sup>12</sup>C, <sup>16</sup>O).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Basic Concepts and Principle of <sup>1</sup>H NMR Spectroscopy:</h3>
<p><strong>Principle:</strong> In a strong magnetic field, nuclei align with or against the field. Radiofrequency radiation induces transitions between these alignments.</p>

<h3>Chemical Shift:</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
<p><em>δ = ((ν<sub>sample</sub> - ν<sub>reference</sub>) / ν<sub>spectrometer</sub>) × 10⁶</em></p>
<p><strong>Units:</strong> Parts per million (ppm).</p>

<h3>Shielding and Deshielding:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Shielding:</strong> High electron density; lower frequency (upfield shift).</li>
    <li><strong>Deshielding:</strong> Low electron density; higher frequency (downfield shift).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):</h3>
<p><strong>Principle:</strong> MRI uses magnetic fields and radio waves to visualize internal structures. Tissue contrast arises from different relaxation times.</p>
<p><strong>Applications:</strong> Diagnosing brain tumors, spinal injuries, joint issues, and more.</p>
