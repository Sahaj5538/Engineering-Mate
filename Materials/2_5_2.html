  <section>
    <h2>Basic Computer Organization and Design</h2>

    <h3>Instruction Codes</h3>
    <p>Instruction codes represent the operation part of machine language instructions, allowing computers to understand and execute commands.</p>

    <h3>Computer Registers</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Accumulator (AC):</strong> Temporary data storage for calculations.</li>
      <li><strong>Program Counter (PC):</strong> Holds address of next instruction.</li>
      <li><strong>Instruction Register (IR):</strong> Holds the instruction currently being executed.</li>
      <li><strong>Memory Address Register (MAR):</strong> Holds address of memory location.</li>
      <li><strong>Memory Buffer Register (MBR):</strong> Holds data from or to memory.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Computer Instructions</h3>
    <p>Instructions can be classified as memory-reference, register-reference, or input-output instructions based on their operation.</p>

    <h3>Timing and Control</h3>
    <p>Responsible for synchronizing all internal operations in the CPU based on clock cycles using control signals.</p>

    <h3>Instruction Cycle</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Fetch</li>
      <li>Decode</li>
      <li>Execute</li>
      <li>Store/Write-back</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Memory Reference Instructions</h3>
    <p>Instructions that involve operations where data is fetched or stored to memory, such as LDA (Load Accumulator), STA (Store Accumulator), ADD, SUB, etc.</p>

    <h3>Input-Output and Interrupt</h3>
    <p>Input-Output operations transfer data between CPU and peripherals. Interrupts are signals that temporarily halt CPU operations to service an urgent task.</p>

    <h3>Complete Computer Description</h3>
    <p>A description that includes data flow, control flow, register setup, memory usage, and instruction cycles to implement a simple basic computer system.</p>
  </section>

    <h2>Microprogrammed Control</h2>

    <h3>Control Memory</h3>
    <p>Control memory holds control information (microinstructions) necessary to generate control signals.</p>

    <h3>Address Sequencing</h3>
    <p>The process of determining the next microinstruction address based on the conditions and control signals.</p>

    <h3>Microprogram Example</h3>
    <p>A sample sequence of microinstructions that implement a macroinstruction (such as ADD or LOAD).</p>

    <h3>Design of Control Unit</h3>
    <p>Design involves developing control memory, microinstruction formats, and methods for sequencing through microinstructions.</p>

    <h3>Microprogram Sequencer</h3>
    <p>A unit that decides the address of the next microinstruction, based on the current instruction and condition flags.</p>

    <h3>Hardwired Control vs Microprogrammed Control</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hardwired Control:</strong> Control signals are generated by combinational logic circuits. Faster but less flexible.</li>
      <li><strong>Microprogrammed Control:</strong> Control signals are stored in memory and accessed like data, making it more flexible but slower.</li>
    </ul>
