<h1>Authentication & Firewall</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p><strong>Authentication</strong> and <strong>Firewall</strong> are two critical concepts in computer and network security. Authentication ensures that users are who they claim to be, while a Firewall controls and filters network traffic to protect against unauthorized access.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Authentication</h2>

    <h3>What is Authentication?</h3>
    <p>Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system before granting access to resources. It is the first line of defense against unauthorized access.</p>

    <h3>Types of Authentication</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Password-based Authentication:</strong> Users authenticate using a secret password.</li>
        <li><strong>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> Combines two different authentication factors, like a password and a mobile code.</li>
        <li><strong>Biometric Authentication:</strong> Uses biological traits like fingerprints, retina scans, or voice recognition.</li>
        <li><strong>Token-based Authentication:</strong> Users authenticate with a token, such as a smart card or mobile app token.</li>
        <li><strong>Certificate-based Authentication:</strong> Digital certificates verify user identity using cryptographic techniques.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Authentication Methods</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Single-Factor Authentication (SFA):</strong> Only one form of verification (e.g., password).</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Requires multiple forms of verification (e.g., password + fingerprint).</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Firewall</h2>

    <h3>What is a Firewall?</h3>
    <p>A Firewall is a security device (hardware or software) that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks (like the Internet).</p>

    <h3>Types of Firewalls</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Packet-Filtering Firewall:</strong> Inspects packets and blocks or allows them based on rules.</li>
        <li><strong>Stateful Inspection Firewall:</strong> Monitors active connections and makes decisions based on the state of the traffic.</li>
        <li><strong>Proxy Firewall:</strong> Acts as an intermediary between users and the services they access.</li>
        <li><strong>Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW):</strong> Offers advanced features like deep packet inspection, intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and application awareness.</li>
        <li><strong>Software Firewalls:</strong> Installed on individual computers to protect against threats.</li>
        <li><strong>Hardware Firewalls:</strong> Standalone appliances that protect entire networks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Functions of a Firewall</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Block unauthorized access to the network.</li>
        <li>Allow legitimate communication as per security rules.</li>
        <li>Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.</li>
        <li>Log events and provide alerts in case of security breaches.</li>
        <li>Protect against malware, ransomware, and data breaches.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Authentication verifies the identity of users to prevent unauthorized access, while firewalls serve as a protective barrier between trusted and untrusted networks. Together, they form the backbone of effective cybersecurity strategies, safeguarding both users and systems from potential threats.</p>
