<h1>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</strong> is a structured process followed by a software development team to design, develop, and test high-quality software. The goal of SDLC is to produce superior software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, is completed within time, and cost estimates.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Phases of SDLC</h2>

    <h3>1. Requirement Gathering and Analysis</h3>
    <p>In this phase, all relevant information is collected from stakeholders to develop the software as per their expectation. It involves:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Understanding client needs</li>
        <li>Feasibility study</li>
        <li>Documenting requirements</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. System Design</h3>
    <p>The system design phase translates requirements into a blueprint for constructing the software. It involves:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Architectural design</li>
        <li>Database design</li>
        <li>User Interface design</li>
        <li>High-level and detailed design</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Implementation (Coding)</h3>
    <p>Actual coding is started during this phase. Developers must ensure that coding standards are followed. It involves:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Writing source code</li>
        <li>Unit testing</li>
        <li>Version control and management</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Testing</h3>
    <p>After coding, the software is tested to find defects and ensure the product solves the business needs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Functional testing</li>
        <li>Performance testing</li>
        <li>Security testing</li>
        <li>User Acceptance Testing (UAT)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Deployment</h3>
    <p>Once the software passes all tests, it is deployed to the production environment for use by end-users. It can be done in stages (phased deployment) or at once (big bang deployment).</p>

    <h3>6. Maintenance</h3>
    <p>Post-deployment, the software may need updates, enhancements, or bug fixes. Maintenance activities include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Corrective Maintenance (fixing issues)</li>
        <li>Adaptive Maintenance (adjusting to environment changes)</li>
        <li>Perfective Maintenance (enhancing functionalities)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Popular SDLC Models</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Waterfall Model:</strong> A sequential design process with no overlap between phases.</li>
        <li><strong>Agile Model:</strong> An iterative and incremental approach that promotes flexible responses to change.</li>
        <li><strong>V-Model:</strong> A sequential path with corresponding testing phase for each development stage.</li>
        <li><strong>Spiral Model:</strong> Focuses on risk assessment and reduction by iterative prototyping and development.</li>
        <li><strong>Iterative Model:</strong> Develops a system through repeated cycles (iterations).</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Advantages of SDLC</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Improves project management and control</li>
        <li>Enhances communication between teams and stakeholders</li>
        <li>Helps in identifying and correcting issues early</li>
        <li>Ensures well-documented and high-quality software</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The Software Development Life Cycle provides a systematic process for building software that ensures the highest quality and lowest cost in the shortest time. Each model and phase has its importance depending on project needs, and choosing the right approach can determine the project's success.</p>
