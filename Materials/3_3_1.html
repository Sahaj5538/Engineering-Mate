<h1>Artificial Intelligence: History and Scope</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>
    <p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. AI enables machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as decision-making, speech recognition, visual perception, and language translation.</p>

    <h2>History of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1943:</strong> Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts published a paper on artificial neurons, marking the beginning of AI theory.</li>
        <li><strong>1950:</strong> Alan Turing introduced the Turing Test to determine if a machine can exhibit human-like intelligence.</li>
        <li><strong>1956:</strong> The term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined by John McCarthy at the Dartmouth Conference, which is considered the birth of AI as a field.</li>
        <li><strong>1950s-1960s:</strong> Early AI research focused on problem-solving and symbolic methods.</li>
        <li><strong>1970s:</strong> Introduction of "knowledge-based systems" and expert systems like MYCIN.</li>
        <li><strong>1980s:</strong> Rise of machine learning and backpropagation algorithms for neural networks.</li>
        <li><strong>1997:</strong> IBMâ€™s Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov.</li>
        <li><strong>2010s:</strong> Major advances in deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision (e.g., Google's AlphaGo beating a human Go champion).</li>
        <li><strong>Present:</strong> AI is integrated into everyday applications like Siri, Alexa, autonomous vehicles, medical diagnostics, and recommendation systems.</li>
    </ul>
