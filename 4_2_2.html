<h1>Deep Learning Architectures</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Deep Learning architectures are specialized structures of neural networks designed to solve complex real-world problems, such as image recognition, natural language understanding, and game playing. These architectures differ in how they process, transform, and understand data.</p>

    <h2>Major Deep Learning Architectures</h2>

    <h3>1. Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)</h3>
    <p>Feedforward networks are the simplest type of artificial neural network where information moves in only one direction—forward—from the input nodes, through the hidden nodes, and to the output nodes. There are no cycles or loops.</p>

    <h3>2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)</h3>
    <p>CNNs are primarily used for analyzing visual data. They use convolutional layers to detect features like edges, textures, and objects in images. CNNs are the backbone of many computer vision tasks such as image classification and object detection.</p>

    <h3>3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)</h3>
    <p>RNNs are designed for sequential data such as time series or text. They maintain a memory of previous inputs by using loops within the network, making them ideal for tasks like language modeling and speech recognition.</p>

    <h3>4. Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)</h3>
    <p>LSTM networks are a special kind of RNN capable of learning long-term dependencies. They solve the problem of vanishing gradients in traditional RNNs, and are used in applications like machine translation, text generation, and speech recognition.</p>

    <h3>5. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)</h3>
    <p>GANs consist of two networks, a generator and a discriminator, that compete with each other. The generator tries to produce realistic data, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake data. GANs are famous for generating realistic images, videos, and voice synthesis.</p>

    <h3>6. Autoencoders</h3>
    <p>Autoencoders are neural networks designed to encode input into a compressed representation and then reconstruct the output from it. They are used for dimensionality reduction, feature learning, and anomaly detection.</p>

    <h3>7. Transformer Networks</h3>
    <p>Transformers are the foundation of many recent advances in NLP (Natural Language Processing). They rely entirely on attention mechanisms to capture dependencies between input and output without using RNNs or CNNs. Transformers power models like BERT, GPT, and T5.</p>
