    <h2>Key Principles of Management</h2>

    <h3>1. Division of Work</h3>
    <p>Specialization increases output by making employees more efficient. Work should be divided among individuals and groups to ensure specialization and build expertise.</p>

    <h3>2. Authority and Responsibility</h3>
    <p>Managers must have the authority to give orders, but they must also bear responsibility for their actions and decisions.</p>

    <h3>3. Discipline</h3>
    <p>Employees must obey and respect the rules and agreements that govern the organization. Discipline requires good supervision and clear and fair agreements.</p>

    <h3>4. Unity of Command</h3>
    <p>Each employee should receive orders from one superior only. This principle prevents confusion and conflict.</p>

    <h3>5. Unity of Direction</h3>
    <p>The organization should have a single plan of action to guide managers and workers. This ensures focused efforts and consistency in goals.</p>

    <h3>6. Subordination of Individual Interests to the General Interest</h3>
    <p>The interests of one employee or group of employees should not take precedence over the interests of the organization as a whole.</p>

    <h3>7. Remuneration</h3>
    <p>Compensation should be fair and provide satisfaction to both employees and employers.</p>

    <h3>8. Centralization and Decentralization</h3>
    <p>There must be a balance between centralization (authority concentrated at top levels) and decentralization (authority distributed to lower levels) depending on the organizationâ€™s needs.</p>

    <h3>9. Scalar Chain</h3>
    <p>A clear chain of command should exist from the top to the bottom of the organization, defining a line of authority.</p>

    <h3>10. Order</h3>
    <p>Materials and people should be in the right place at the right time. Proper organization ensures efficiency and discipline.</p>

    <h3>11. Equity</h3>
    <p>Managers should treat employees with kindness and justice to create loyalty and devotion.</p>

    <h3>12. Stability of Tenure</h3>
    <p>High employee turnover is inefficient. Stability of tenure promotes loyalty and efficiency.</p>

    <h3>13. Initiative</h3>
    <p>Employees should be encouraged to show initiative. It can enhance motivation and bring new ideas to the organization.</p>

    <h3>14. Esprit de Corps</h3>
    <p>Promoting team spirit will build harmony and unity within the organization, leading to greater performance.</p>
