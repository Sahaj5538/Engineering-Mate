<h1>Software Testing</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p><strong>Software Testing</strong> is a process of evaluating a software application to identify errors, gaps, or missing requirements. The purpose of testing is to ensure that the software works as expected and meets the specified requirements.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Why is Software Testing Important?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensures the quality of the product.</li>
        <li>Reduces the risk of failure in production.</li>
        <li>Identifies bugs and issues early in the development lifecycle.</li>
        <li>Improves customer satisfaction by delivering error-free products.</li>
        <li>Ensures the software is reliable, secure, and performs well.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Types of Software Testing</h2>

    <h3>1. Manual Testing</h3>
    <p>Testing software manually without using any automation tools. Testers execute test cases by hand.</p>

    <h3>2. Automation Testing</h3>
    <p>Using tools and scripts to perform tests automatically without human intervention (e.g., Selenium, JUnit).</p>
</section>

    <h2>Levels of Software Testing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Unit Testing:</strong> Testing individual components or pieces of code for correctness.</li>
        <li><strong>Integration Testing:</strong> Testing combined parts of an application to determine if they function together correctly.</li>
        <li><strong>System Testing:</strong> Testing the complete system to verify that it meets the specified requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Acceptance Testing:</strong> Conducted to determine whether the system satisfies user needs and is ready for deployment.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Testing Methods</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Black Box Testing:</strong> Testing without knowledge of internal workings; focus on input and output.</li>
        <li><strong>White Box Testing:</strong> Testing with knowledge of the internal logic of the system's code.</li>
        <li><strong>Gray Box Testing:</strong> Combination of Black Box and White Box Testing techniques.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Popular Software Testing Techniques</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Smoke Testing:</strong> Basic tests to check if the critical functionalities are working.</li>
        <li><strong>Regression Testing:</strong> Re-running functional and non-functional tests to ensure that previously developed and tested software still performs after a change.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Testing:</strong> Testing the speed, responsiveness, and stability under a workload.</li>
        <li><strong>Load Testing:</strong> Testing how the system behaves under a large amount of data or users.</li>
        <li><strong>Stress Testing:</strong> Testing the system beyond its normal operational capacity.</li>
        <li><strong>Usability Testing:</strong> Testing how user-friendly and intuitive the application is.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Testing:</strong> Testing the software's ability to protect data and maintain functionality as intended.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Requirement Analysis</li>
        <li>Test Planning</li>
        <li>Test Case Development</li>
        <li>Environment Setup</li>
        <li>Test Execution</li>
        <li>Test Cycle Closure</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Software Testing is an essential part of software development. It ensures the delivery of high-quality products to users and saves businesses from costly failures. A good testing process leads to efficient development, happy users, and successful software products.</p>
