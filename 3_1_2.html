<h1>Routing and Switching</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p><strong>Routing</strong> and <strong>Switching</strong> are fundamental concepts in computer networking. They determine how data moves through a network, from source to destination, efficiently and reliably.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Switching</h2>
    <p><strong>Switching</strong> refers to the process of directing data packets between devices within the same network. It operates mainly at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) of the OSI model.</p>

    <h3>Types of Switching</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Circuit Switching:</strong> Establishes a dedicated communication path between two devices (used in traditional telephone networks).</li>
        <li><strong>Packet Switching:</strong> Data is divided into packets and each packet can take any path to the destination (used in the Internet).</li>
        <li><strong>Message Switching:</strong> Whole messages are switched and stored until the next link is available.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Network Switch</h3>
    <p>A network switch connects devices in a LAN and uses MAC addresses to forward data to the correct destination. Unlike hubs, switches are intelligent devices that reduce collisions and improve network efficiency.</p>
</section>

    <h2>Routing</h2>
    <p><strong>Routing</strong> is the process of selecting a path for traffic in a network, or across multiple networks. It typically operates at Layer 3 (Network Layer) of the OSI model.</p>

    <h3>Types of Routing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Static Routing:</strong> Routes are manually configured and do not change unless manually updated.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Routing:</strong> Routers automatically adjust their paths based on network conditions using protocols.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Routing Algorithms</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Distance Vector Routing:</strong> Routers inform their neighbors of topology changes periodically. Example: RIP (Routing Information Protocol).</li>
        <li><strong>Link State Routing:</strong> Routers have a full map of the network and compute the shortest path. Example: OSPF (Open Shortest Path First).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Routing Protocols</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>RIP (Routing Information Protocol):</strong> A simple Distance Vector protocol with a maximum hop count of 15.</li>
        <li><strong>OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):</strong> A Link State protocol using Dijkstra's algorithm for the shortest path.</li>
        <li><strong>BGP (Border Gateway Protocol):</strong> The protocol that makes the internet work by exchanging routing information between ISPs.</li>
        <li><strong>EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol):</strong> A Cisco proprietary protocol combining features of both Distance Vector and Link State routing.</li>
    </ul>

<section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Routing and Switching are essential for building efficient and scalable networks. While switching helps devices within a network communicate, routing enables communication between different networks, including the internet.</p>
